# Architecture

- source code should be in src directory
- GitHub actions should be in .github/workflows directory
- use cases will be described as markdown user stories in the docs/use-cases directory

- Infrastructure
  - it will have Elasticsearch as database and search
  - it will have Elasticsearch client
  - it will have Elasticsearch repository
  - it will see only Domain layer
  - it will implement interfaces defined in the Domain layer
  - every technology will have its own directory within the Infrastructure layer, e.g. `Infrastructure/Elasticsearch`
- Application
  - it will have use cases
  - it will have DTOs
  - it will see only Domain layer
  - it will glue UserInterface and Domain layer
  - every kind of class will have its own directory within the Application layer, e.g. `Application/UseCase`
- Domain
